## TLDR;

<span class="inline-step">1</span> **Exporting from array or collection**

Using the `FromCollection` and `FromArray` concerns any type list of rows can be exported.

<span class="inline-step">2</span> **Exporting a Model query**

Models can be exported using the `FromQuery` concern. Behind the scenes the query will be chunked for improved performance.

<span class="inline-step">3</span> **Exporting a Blade View**

To have more control on how the export should be presented `FromView` can be used with a Blade view that has a HTML table.
